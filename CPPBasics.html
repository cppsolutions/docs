<p></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a contributory plan</span><span class="rvts6">&nbsp;meaning that the benefit you receive when you retire depends on the amount you contributed to the plan during your working years. CPP is not funded by general tax revenues as is the Old Age Security Pension. &nbsp;To qualify to receive CPP, you must be over the age of 60 and you must have made at least one valid contribution (payment) into Canada Pension Plan. &nbsp;The amount of your CPP pension will depend on how much and for how long you&nbsp;have contributed (contributory period) to the CPP&nbsp;and on your age when you decide to begin your pension. </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Your </span><span class="rvts11">contributory period</span><span class="rvts6">&nbsp;begins&nbsp;when you reach age 18 (or January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1966, whichever is later) and&nbsp;ends&nbsp;when you either start receiving your CPP retirement pension, begin to receive a&nbsp;CPP&nbsp;disability benefit, turn 70 years of age, or you pass away. You make contributions only on your annual earnings between a&nbsp;minimum&nbsp;and a&nbsp;maximum&nbsp;amount (these are called your </span><span class="rvts11">pensionable earnings</span><span class="rvts6">). The minimum amount is frozen at $3,500 and is known as the Year's Basic Exemption (YBE). The maximum amount is set each January, based on increases in the average wage in Canada (</span><span class="rvts19">Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE))</span><span class="rvts6">.</span><span class="rvts20">&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts6">The&nbsp;YMPE&nbsp;is approximately the average Canadian wage. It is calculated using a CPP legislated formula that takes into account the growth in average weekly wages and salaries in Canada.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">For example, in 2017, the YMPE amount is $55,300. The contribution rate on these pensionable earnings is 9.9&nbsp;percent, split equally between you and your employer. If you are self-employed, you pay the full 9.9&nbsp;percent. For example, the maximum contribution for employers and employees in 2017 is&nbsp;[($55,300 - $3,500) x 4.95%] $2,564.10&nbsp;each. If you are self-employed, the maximum contribution is&nbsp;$5,128.20. Your contributions are based on your net business income (after expenses).</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The CPP benefit amount you receive considers periods where you had zero or low earnings. A certain number of your lowest earnings years may be automatically dropped from the pension calculation under the "</span><span class="rvts11">general drop-out provision</span><span class="rvts6">". You should also request the "</span><span class="rvts11">child-rearing provision</span><span class="rvts6">" if you had zero or low earnings because you were the primary caregiver raising your children. There is also a less known “</span><span class="rvts11">over-65 provision”</span><span class="rvts6">&nbsp;that allows you to drop out any earnings that are lower than earnings prior to 65 or use higher earning years after 65 to replace lower earnings years before the age of 65.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps7"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts21">How the age you begin your benefit will affect your monthly payment</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The standard age for beginning to receive your CPP retirement pension is the month after your 65th birthday. However, you can take a reduced pension as early as age 60 or begin receiving an increased pension after age 65. If you take the CPP retirement pension early before age 65, it is reduced by 0.6% for each month you receive it before age 65 (7.2% per year). This means an individual who starts receiving their CPP retirement pension at the age of 60 will receive 36% less than if they had taken it at 65.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If you decide to begin your pension after age 65, your monthly payment amount will increase by 0.7% for each month after age 65 that you delay receiving it up to age 70 (8.4% per year). This means that, an individual who starts receiving their retirement pension at the age of 70 will receive 42% more than if they had taken it at 65.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts25">* </span><span class="rvts6">Please remember the benefit that is increased or reduced by the age adjustment factor is the </span><span class="rvts12">estimated</span><span class="rvts6">&nbsp;pension benefit that you would have received at age 65 not necessary the maximum CPP amount.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps7"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts21">Post Retirement Benefit (PRB)</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If you work while receiving your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) retirement pension, you may increase your retirement income with a lifetime benefit. This is called the</span><span class="rvts22">&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts23">Post-Retirement Benefit (PRB)</span><span class="rvts6">. If you are&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts11">60 to 65</span><span class="rvts6">&nbsp;years of age and work while receiving a CPP retirement pension, you and your employer </span><span class="rvts11">must</span><span class="rvts6">&nbsp;make CPP contributions. If you are&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts11">65 to 70</span><span class="rvts6">&nbsp;years of age and work while receiving a CPP retirement pension, you can&nbsp;choose&nbsp;whether or not you want to contribute to the PRB. You may later change this decision and start contributing again. However, only one change can be made per calendar year. To receive this benefit, you and you</span><span class="rvts22">r&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts6">employer</span><span class="rvts22">&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts6">have to make</span><span class="rvts22">&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts6">CP</span><span class="rvts22">P&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts6">contributions. If you are&nbsp;self-employed, you have to pay both the employee and the employer portions of the&nbsp;CPP/PRB&nbsp;contributions. Once you reach 70, you will stop making</span><span class="rvts22">&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts6">PRB</span><span class="rvts22">&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts6">contributions. The PRB begins on Jan 1 the year after you have made contributions, any new payments during the year increase your PRB amount the following year.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps7"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts21">General drop-out provision</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Over the course of your working life, you might have had periods where you had low or zero earnings. Such periods can occur for a variety of reasons, such as going to school, becoming unemployed, or leaving the workforce to provide care to a family member. Receiving CPP disability does not affect this provision directly. In order to help with this reality the CPP automatically drops a number of months of your lowest earnings when calculating your CPP benefit. For example, the general dropout rule currently allows you to exclude the lowest 17 per cent of your lifetime earnings when your CPP is calculated. At age 65, this means you can drop out at least eight years of low earnings, so your CPP would be based on your best 39 years of earnings out of a possible 47 (from the age of 18 to 65).</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps7"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts21">Child-rearing provision</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If you stopped working or received lower earnings to care for your children up until the age of </span><span class="rvts12">seven</span><span class="rvts6">, you may be able to use the "child-rearing provision" to increase your CPP benefits. Caring for young children can mean leaving the work force or working fewer hours. If your earnings stopped or were lower because you were the primary caregiver, you can request the child-rearing provision. If you are deemed eligible, the child-rearing period will be excluded from the&nbsp;contributory period&nbsp;when calculating your CPP benefit amount, ensuring that you get the highest possible payment. You should request the child-rearing provision when you apply for any CPP benefit.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps7"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts21">Working over- 65 provision</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If your earnings after age 65 are less than any of your under-age 65 APE or if you are not working after age 65 , you can simply drop out all periods after age 65 from your CPP calculations. If you are still working after age 65, you can use these earnings to replace any periods of time under age 65 where you had lower earnings.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps7"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts21">CPP Survivors Benefit</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If you are the legal spouse or common-law partner of a deceased contributor you may be entitled to a survivor's pension. This report and analyzer doesn’t specifically look at the survivors benefits calculation because it is assumed that the user of this analyzer does have a CPP pension payable in the future and therefore be will interested in the </span><span class="rvts12">combined survivors benefit calculation</span><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps7"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts21">Combined Survivors and CPP benefit</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If you already receive the CPP&nbsp;or&nbsp;CPP </span><a class="rvts24" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/cpp-disability-benefit.html">disability benefit</a><span class="rvts6">, the survivor's pension will be combined with them into a single monthly payment. This analyzer only considers the CPP plus survivors combination. Very important fact to note is that you do not receive your spouse’s full CPP or even 60% of the benefit if your spouse should predecease you. The most that can be paid to a person who is eligible for the retirement pension and the survivor's pension is the maximum retirement pension (which is more than the maximum survivor's pension). The total amount of combined CPP benefits paid is adjusted based on the survivor's age and other benefits received.</span></p>
